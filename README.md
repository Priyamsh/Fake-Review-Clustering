# Fake-Review-Clustering

This project uses various features like Tfidf vector, average rating deviation, etc and feeds it into the K-means clustering algorithm.

After clustering there were some discrepancies which I had to manually eliminate from the dataset.

I was able to predict 1000 fake reviews from a dataset that contained 10000 reviews.
